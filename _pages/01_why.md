<a style='color:red;'>TODO: Explain why I create this

--- Some numbers:
- 28% of women in Vietnam hold a PhD Degree only (Page 71, [source](https://www.gso.gov.vn/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Thong-tin-gioi-VN-2021_final.pdf))
- At Hanoi University of Science and Technology, the number of female faculty is 35%, while the number of female students is 21%. The number of female faculty who hold a PhD is about 250, roughly making up 30% of the female faculty.

Throughout my academic journey, I have never once stopped doubting if I belong in this field.

It has been almost 12 years since high school when I decided to pursue a Mathematics class; then 8 years ago, when I opted for a CS-related major in undergrad, and... 3 years since I started considering higher education in CS.

I think having self-doubt is fine. Everyone has flaws or insecurities. But along my journey in Computer Science, I have noticed that I typically face more sociocultural stressors than my male peers.

I tried to find a research paper on this topic in Vietnam, but unfortunately, I could not find any. Instead, I found some reports/statistics that might partially speak up.

Engendering Access to STEM Education and Careers in South Asia (World Bank report) provides some pertinent findings:

- "There were several overarching sociocultural factors that influenced the experiences of girls and women in the STEM field. In multiple cases, researchers found that STEM careers were perceived as inappropriate for women. [...] These sociocultural factors can influence girls’ career paths, as seen in both Indonesia and Vietnam where women were shown to have a high interest in STEM subjects yet did not want to work in the STEM field."
- "The reality of STEM education for girls in Vietnam reports [...] determined that not all teachers understood what STEM education was and that many held a bias against girls when asked about the suitability of STEM careers for their students. Female students perceived themselves as skilled in STEM subjects but did not want to pursue them professionally, with differences in preferences, attitudes, confidence, and career trends between male and female students."
- "Perceptions of self, interest, and difficulty are key factors that influence the extent to which students engage with subjects. When students lack interest, confidence, and success in a subject, they are less likely to continue their studies in that area. Negative stereotypes around girls’ and women’s capabilities in STEM create learning environments that do not encourage success or interest. A study of female students in STEM programs at RMIT International University in Vietnam found that they often experience anxiety when entering the program due to the perception that IT is traditionally a male choice."
- "The study found seven reasons for the importance of encouraging the participation of girls: Narrowing gender gaps in STEM-related careers, enhancing gender equality, removing gender stereotypes, creating diversified opportunities for girls to develop general skills, improving female students’ performances on STEM-related subjects, helping girls have more opportunities to pursue careers in the future, and increasing the rate of female students choosing STEM-related subjects/areas in higher levels of education." 
- "A survey by the International Labour Organization (ILO, 2016), ‘National Programme on Educational Technology and Science, 2018,’ also showed that more Vietnamese students choose to study economics fields compared to engineering fields. STEM occupations are selected by only 23% of male students and 9% of female students. This is lower than the ASEAN country average, where 28% of male students and 17% of female students select STEM occupations."
