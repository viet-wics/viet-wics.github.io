### Q: How to submit a new entry? 🙋🏻

A: There are currently three (03) ways to submit an entry:

1. **Create a GitHub [issue](https://github.com/viet-wics/viet-wics.github.io/issues) or [pull request](https://github.com/viet-wics/viet-wics.github.io/pulls)**: This is the fastest way and usually takes from a few hours to a few days for processing.
2. **Fill out [this Google Forms](https://forms.gle/98zNTRNujsDfGzui9)**: This is the most convenient option, although it may take ~7 days for me to update the information.
3. **Via email**: Simply send us an email with the nominee's name (and links to their personal page or LinkedIn, if applicable). Please note that this method may take longer (around 7-10 days), as I do not check our email regularly.

### Q: What are the criteria for entry? 🤔

A: Currently, this project is focused on individuals in higher education (PhD).

While I recognize the abundance of talents in the field, I may not be able to cover everyone due to potential volume constraints (This project is also run by a single student, so please be patient!)

Our current criteria are: 

1. Women or self-identifying **Vietnamese women**.
2. Holding or pursuing a **Computer Science PhD**.

In the future, I may expand current criteria to encompass a more diverse group of individuals. Unfortunately, at this moment, I do not have a timeline for this expansion (sorry!).

### Q: Is there something wrong with the information? Or do you want to remove your information? 🤦🏼‍♀️

A: Please either <a href="https://github.com/viet-wics/viet-wics.github.io/issues">create a GitHub issue/pull request</a> or email me at **vietwics@gmail.com** to correct the information.

If you don't want your information to be shown here, feel free to drop me an email as well; I will remove it as soon as possible. Thank you!


### Q: Hasn't this been done before? 💭

A: To my knowledge, the most similar project is [Vietnamese Professor in US](https://github.com/dynaroars/dynaroars.github.io/wiki/Viet-CS-Profs-US). However, while "Vietnamese Professors in US" focuses on Vietnamese professors in the United States (as the name also indicated), this project specifically centers on Vietnamese women with higher education in Computer Science.

### Q: I have an idea for making this even better! What should I do? 💡

A: Please either <a href="https://github.com/viet-wics/viet-wics.github.io/issues">create a GitHub issue</a> or email me at **vietwics@gmail.com**. I will do my best to get back to you within a few days. If you don't hear back after 7 days, please feel free to email me again.

### Q: Who is involved with this project? 🪴

A: This project is currently maintained by a single student. It is non-profit and purely for educational purposes. I am not affiliated with any organization or institution.

<!-- The idea for this project originally popped into my head in 2019 when I was searching for a valid reason, external affirmation, or self-affirmation to apply for a Computer Science PhD program. No surprise, **I couldn't find any role models online**.

However, I wouldn't have been brave enough to create this project without the awesome *Education Psychology 506 Course (Stereotypes, Discrimination, and Education)*, where I learned about the importance of representation and the power of role models.

So yes, the issues exist, the invisible barriers (e.g., social norms, cultural norms, stereotype threat) exist... And I am not the only one who faced them. (But luckily, I overcame them). 

So here I am, trying to make a small contribution to the community. I hope during my minor study (hopefully in Education Psychology), I continue to learn more and gradually extend this project.

Thank you!
