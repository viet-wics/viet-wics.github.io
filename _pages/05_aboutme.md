Hi, I'm Thao! 👋
I'm a graduate student @ UW - Madison 🦡, working with Prof. Yong Jae Lee.
I'm fortunate to also have support from senior students: Dr. Utkarsh Ojha, Dr. Yuheng Li, Dr. Haotian Liu 🌋, and Mu Cai (Check out their works, you won't regret!).

Before that, I spent three wonderful years @ VinAI Research, where I had the privilege of working closely with Dr. Anh Tran, Prof. Minh Hoai Nguyen, Dr. Duc Thanh Nguyen, and so many amazing folks.
These people have motivated me to pursuit higher education.
Thank you! 🙇‍♀️🎓
