Hi, I'm a female Vietnamese CS PhD student, currently pursuing a minor in Educational Psychology.

This project came to my mind in 2019 while I was applying for a PhD in CS, driven by my desire to confirm that many Vietnamese women can succeed in this field.

Unfortunately, I cannot.

At that time, I was bold enough to apply and fortunate enough to be accepted (by some universities).

Over the last two years, I often wondered if it was just me -- perhaps women normally wouldn't choose to pursue a PhD in Computer Science -- that's the truth.
But the curiosity remained: am I the only one? Is it true that women face many "invisible" barriers to pursuing STEM (especially higher education)?

That curiosity finally led me to take a course in Educational Psychology, where I realized that I was not alone.

Thus, this project was officially launched â€” and I strive to maintain it as long as I can.

I hope this might inspire another junior version of myself to pursue a PhD in CS.

No worries, we got this âœ¨
