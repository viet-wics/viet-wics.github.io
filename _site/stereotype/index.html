<p>“Am I a good fit for the field of STEM?”<br />
“Should girls even consider studying Computer ?”</p>

<p>Ten years ago, back in 2014—I was a high school senior preparing for the Vietnamese National High School Graduation Examination (“Kỳ thi Trung học Phổ thông Quốc gia”). Like many other students at that time, I spent countless hours worrying about choosing the right major and career path.</p>

<p><img src="/profile-images/toank24.JPG" width="600" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Vietnamese National High School Graduation Examination is a standardized test in the Vietnamese education system that all Vietnamese high school students must takes. The results of this test will be use for: (1) High School Graduation (2) Admission to undergraduate programs of universities or junior colleges. – According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_School_Graduation_Examination">Wikipedia, “High School Graduation Examination”</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wanted to apply for the <a href="https://ts.hust.edu.vn/en/program/mathematics-informatics">Mathematics-Informatics program</a> at <a href="https://hust.edu.vn/">Hanoi University of Science and Technology</a> (top #1 university in Vietnam for STEM). But I hesitated. The 17-year-old me was riddled with self-doubt:</p>

<p><img src="/profile-images/toank24-girl.jpg" width="600" /></p>

<p>“Am I really cut out for this field?”</p>

<p>Back then, I had so many questions, uncertainties, and no clear answers. Yet somehow, for various reasons and through a series of choices, here I am, ten years later, working in this very field.</p>

<p>If I could go back to 2014, what would I say to the younger version of myself grappling with those doubts?</p>

<p>This post is for young girls out there looking for a glimmer of hope or a reason to pursue Computer Science. I hope my story—though deeply personal and far from comprehensive—can offer you some perspective on what it means to be a woman in this field.</p>

<p><strong>About Me</strong></p>

<p>Hello there, I’m Thao (<a href="https://thaoshibe.github.io/">Thao Nguyen</a>). Currently, I’m a Ph.D. student in <a href="https://www.cs.wisc.edu/">Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison</a>, USA.</p>

<p>I graduated from Thai Nguyen High School for the Gifted, majoring in Mathematics (Class K24). Later, I pursued a degree in Mathematics and Computer Science (<a href="https://hust.edu.vn/en/academics/academic-programs/talented-programs-368400.html">Talent Engineering Program</a>) at Hanoi University of Science and Technology.</p>

<p>In my final year of university (2019), I was fortunate to be among the first 10 AI Residents at <a href="https://www.vinai.io/vinai-ai-residency/">VinAI Research</a> (Batch 1). My experiences at VinAI were instrumental in opening doors to research and eventually led me to apply for a Ph.D. program in the United States.</p>

<p>As I write this (December 2024), I am in my third year of the Ph.D. program, working under Professor <a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~yongjaelee/">Yong Jae Lee</a>. Beyond Computer Science, I am also pursuing a Ph.D. Minor in Educational Psychology.</p>

<h3 id="the-doubts-i-used-to-have">The Doubts I Used to Have…</h3>
<p>I’ve had plenty of questions and uncertainties about this field. But what stands out most—what I remember most vividly—are three key questions:</p>

<p>Is scientific research/science and technology a field meant only for men?
Is scientific research/science and technology only for those with innate intelligence?
Are women in scientific research/science and technology often unattractive and less likely to find love or get married?
Before diving into each question, I want to say that having questions like these, and feeling uneasy about them, is entirely normal. Questions like “Can I do well in this field?” or “Do I have the traits or qualities necessary for people in this field?” are perfectly reasonable and natural.</p>

<p>In Educational Psychology, this process is called prototype matching, or, in simpler terms, “comparing yourself to role models.” When making a decision to pursue something, people often tend to compare themselves to “role models” who might have made similar choices. Their decision is influenced by how closely they perceive themselves to align with these models.</p>

<p>For example, when you’re searching for housing near your university, you might explore where other students from your school usually rent. This shapes your decision. This process of self-to-prototype matching has been shown in many studies to affect whether a student chooses to pursue a particular major. For instance, if you feel you resemble the “role models” you associate with science and technology, you’re more likely to feel confident about choosing that field. Conversely, if you feel you don’t match those role models, you might hesitate or question your ability to succeed in it.</p>

<p>Prototype matching is a strategy whereby decisions—from the mundane to the profound—are influenced by overlap in one’s self-concept with impressions of a prototypical other… [abridged] when making a complex social decision such as where to live next school year or whether to begin smoking as an adolescent, people compare themselves with a prototype of the typical person who would choose each possible option, and choose the outcome that produces the least discrepancy between the self and the prototype.
Source: The Role of Prototype Matching in Science Pursuits: Perceptions of Scientists That Are Inaccurate and Diverge From Self-Perceptions Predict Reduced Interest in a Science Career</p>

<p>Scientific research/science and technology is one of those fields that I think comes with many “role models” or stereotypes (e.g., “usually male,” “intelligent,” “socially awkward,” etc.).</p>

<p>I’ve been through these processes myself and found that these “role models” and the act of “comparing yourself to them” can sometimes discourage you from choosing a path in science and engineering.</p>

<p>Research “—” has shown that female students, when they feel they don’t match the “science researcher” archetype, are less likely to register for science and technology-related courses. For example…</p>

<p>Now that I understand how “role models” can influence the decision to study a field, let’s revisit the common “role models” people often associate with scientific research/science and technology!</p>

<p>— Science and Technology/ Scientific Research is for Boys
<strong>Research Paper About Visual Collaboration</strong></p>

<p>I’m not sure where this “stereotype” originated, but it’s probably one of the most common and earliest ones. In a study conducted by Heriot-Watt University, when students aged 13–17 were asked to draw their “image” of Computer Science, many of them portrayed scientists as boys, nerds, geeks, etc.</p>

<p><img href="/profile-images/draw-a-computer.png" width="600" /></p>

<p>This cannot be true. It may be that, currently, there are fewer female scientists than male scientists, but that does not mean women cannot do science.</p>

<p>There are many brilliant female scientists and researchers – for example, this website, and according to statistics, up to <strong>xx%</strong> are women. This proves that women can complete scientific research and work in this field. And I can assure you, there are plenty of women conducting scientific research every single day.</p>

<hr />

<p>Beyond the gender-specific “stereotypes,” I’ve also felt uncomfortable about the idea that if I pursued scientific research, I wouldn’t share the same interests or environment as others who are passionate about science. Maybe it’s because of shows like <em>The Big Bang Theory</em> or Google searches and media portrayal, which ingrained an image that scientists have to be “cool, eccentric,” etc.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HluANRwPyNo?si=-OAPM5Q3SMQTs9_t" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>When I attended a course on Educational Psychology, I learned that there’s actually a term for this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ambient belonging… includes fit with the material (e.g., physical objects) and structural (e.g., layout) components of an environment along with a sense of fit with the people who are imagined to occupy that environment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For example, if you imagine yourself as a computer scientist, you might picture being in a dark room, programming intensely… Research has shown that when students are presented with [summarize study findings], ambient belonging can reduce their interest in pursuing the field.</p>

<p>To be honest, I used to think this stereotype was accurate, but then I realized how ridiculous it is. You can decorate your workspace however you like, and not every programmer is as “cool and eccentric” as portrayed on TV. I have a few pictures of my desk at VinAI – and from large companies…</p>

<p><img href="/profile-images/uw-madison-room.jpg" width="600" />
<img href="/profile-images/my-room.jpg" width="600" />
<img href="/profile-images/adobe-room.jpg" width="600" /></p>

<p>Additionally, I was fortunate enough to attend two major conferences in AI (NeurIPS 2023) and Computer Vision (CVPR 2024), where many women participated… showcasing their individuality. For instance, when you create posters for presentations, you can fully unleash your creativity!</p>

<p>![Insert conference poster image here]</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Quick summary: Women can do science, and the “stereotypes” you imagine about the field may not be as accurate as you think!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can be whoever you are and still pursue science.</p>

<hr />

<p>Science and Technology/ Doing Research – Reserved for Geniuses?</p>

<p>It’s true that many people with “innate talent” choose to pursue science and technology or scientific research. However, in reality, there are far more “ordinary” people in science than you might think. A study by [Starr] showed that using terms like “nerdy” and such negatively impacts women’s motivation to engage in science and technology.</p>

<p>As quoted in an article by Hanoi University of Science and Technology: “Scientific research is, in fact, just another profession.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I’m not a Science Nerd!”: STEM Stereotypes, Identity, and Motivation Among Undergraduate Women<br />
Stereotypes reduce women’s identification with science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM), which can decrease their motivation to enter STEM domains. Stereotypes may be gender-based (e.g., STEM is for men) or trait-based (e.g., STEM is for geniuses). …<br />
The results highlight the unique contributions of different stereotypes toward women’s STEM identity and, in turn, their motivation to pursue STEM pathways. Practice implications include addressing nerd-genius stereotypes in STEM interventions and reducing classroom artifacts that might be reminiscent of these stereotypes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This stereotype shouldn’t exist. I haven’t completed my PhD yet, so I can’t say much, but I’ll translate Professor Matt Might’s words here:<br />
<a href="https://matt.might.net/articles/successful-phd-students/">https://matt.might.net/articles/successful-phd-students/</a></p>

<p>From another perspective, I used to think that doing science meant working on complicated, incomprehensible things [insert image], but I later realized there are countless topics in Computer Science you can explore. If you enjoy “complex computations,” you can pursue it, like [your teacher]. If you prefer other topics… those are possible too.</p>

<p>Indeed, there are many aspects of Computer Science research, forming a whole spectrum for you to explore.</p>

<hr />

<p>And, Girls Studying STEM/ Doing Research Are “Unattractive” or Will Stay Single?</p>

<p>I’ve heard this way too many times from friends and relatives. Even at Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST), everyone knows the infamous saying:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“HUST boys are like parrots,<br />
HUST girls are like baked cassava roots.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Comparing “HUST girls” to “cassava roots” often carries more criticism than praise. It’s true that female students at HUST may focus less on grooming or lack glamorous appearances, and no “HUST girl” has ever won beauty pageants like those at Foreign Trade University or National Economics University…</p>

<p>[Summarize relevant research – e.g., <em>Effects of Everyday Romantic Goal Pursuit on Women’s Attitudes Toward Math and Science</em>]</p>

<p>From my personal experience, however, studying technology does not make you less attractive. On the contrary, I feel grateful that studying STEM allowed me to meet many talented and kind male peers!</p>

<p>Additionally, just look at these examples, and I hope you can view science more positively. Scientists can love and live just like anyone else…</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Reflecting on the Reasons I Kept Going</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Curiosity</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Curious to see how far a small girl can go with determination.</li>
      <li>Curious about this world… Science opens up travel opportunities!</li>
      <li>Curious to learn what failure teaches me.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Failure</strong><br />
Yes, it sounds counterintuitive, but I wanted to keep going because I’ve failed so many times. You may not know, but I’ve failed countless times:
    <ul>
      <li>In college, I failed <em>Economics Math</em> three times and had to replace it with Japanese Language to graduate.</li>
      <li>In 2020, I applied to 12 U.S. universities and was rejected by all of them.</li>
      <li>In 2021, I applied to 19 U.S. universities and was accepted by only two.<br />
![Insert chibird-style motivational drawing]</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Each rejection hurt, but I kept reminding myself that today’s failure doesn’t mean my future is doomed. I kept trying to learn what failure could teach me.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Gratitude</strong><br />
Words of gratitude might never end.<br />
I want to keep striving because I’m grateful for what I have, for the people I’ve met and am meeting.</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<p>I hope this article gives you a new perspective and (even better) inspires students who are unsure about their choice of major to confidently pick Technology, especially pursuing a graduate degree in Computer Science.</p>
