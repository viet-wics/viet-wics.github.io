  <p>I graduated from Thai Nguyen High School for the Gifted, majoring in Mathematics (Class K24). Later, I pursued a degree in Mathematics and Computer Science (<a href="https://hust.edu.vn/en/academics/academic-programs/talented-programs-368400.html">Talent Engineering Program</a>) at Hanoi University of Science and Technology.</p>

  <p>In my final year of university (2019), I was fortunate to be among the first 10 AI Residents at <a href="https://www.vinai.io/vinai-ai-residency/">VinAI Research</a> (Batch 1). My experiences at VinAI were instrumental in opening doors to research and eventually led me to apply for a PhD program in the United States.</p>

  <p>As I write this (December 2024), I am in my third year of the Ph.D. program, working with Professor <a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~yongjaelee/">Yong Jae Lee</a>. Beyond Computer Science, I am also pursuing a PhD Minor in Educational Psychology.</p>

<h3 id="the-doubts-i-used-to-have-and-is-it-normal-to-have-these-doubts">The Doubts I Used to Have… And is it normal to have these doubts?</h3>

<!-- I’ve had plenty of questions and uncertainties about this field. But what stands out most—what I remember most vividly—are three key questions:

Is scientific research/science and technology a field meant only for men?
Is scientific research/science and technology only for those with innate intelligence?
Are women in scientific research/science and technology often unattractive and less likely to find love or get married?
Before diving into each question, I want to say that having questions like these, and feeling uneasy about them, is entirely normal. Questions like "Can I do well in this field?" or "Do I have the traits or qualities necessary for people in this field?" are perfectly reasonable and natural.

In Educational Psychology, this process is called prototype matching, or, in simpler terms, "comparing yourself to role models." When making a decision to pursue something, people often tend to compare themselves to "role models" who might have made similar choices. Their decision is influenced by how closely they perceive themselves to align with these models.

For example, when you’re searching for housing near your university, you might explore where other students from your school usually rent. This shapes your decision. This process of self-to-prototype matching has been shown in many studies to affect whether a student chooses to pursue a particular major. For instance, if you feel you resemble the "role models" you associate with science and technology, you’re more likely to feel confident about choosing that field. Conversely, if you feel you don’t match those role models, you might hesitate or question your ability to succeed in it.

Scientific research/science and technology is one of those fields that I think comes with many "role models" or stereotypes (e.g., "usually male," "intelligent," "socially awkward," etc.).

I’ve been through these processes myself and found that these "role models" and the act of "comparing yourself to them" can sometimes discourage you from choosing a path in science and engineering.

Research "---" has shown that female students, when they feel they don’t match the "science researcher" archetype, are less likely to register for science and technology-related courses. For example...

Now that I understand how "role models" can influence the decision to study a field, let’s revisit the common "role models" people oftenassociate with scientific research/science and technology! --->

<h3 id="computer-science-is-for-men">Computer Science is for Men</h3>
<!-- **Research Paper About Visual Collaboration** -->

<p><i><strong>Computer Scientist is a men</strong></i></p>

<p>I’m not entirely certain about the origin of this “stereotype,” but it’s likely one of the most pervasive and long-standing misconceptions. A study by Heriot-Watt University revealed a telling insight: <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-43118-010">when students aged 13–17 were asked to draw their perception of Computer Science, many depicted scientists as boys, nerds, and geeks</a>.</p>

<p><i>Caption: When students aged 13–17 were asked to draw their perception of Computer Science, many depicted scientists as men.</i>
<br /></p>

<p>This narrative is fundamentally flawed. While it’s true that currently fewer women are represented in scientific fields, this does NOT imply that women are inherently incapable of scientific pursuits.</p>

<p>Numerous brilliant female scientists and researchers demonstrate the contrary. According to statistics, <a href="https://viet-wics.github.io/stat/">up to 30% are women</a>, conclusively proving that women can not only engage in scientific research but excel in it.
I can confidently affirm that women are conducting groundbreaking scientific work every single day. Especially for Vietnam, there are so many talented Vietnamese women are working in Computer Sciences, with a variety of domain (e.g., Computer Vision, Natual Language Processing, Machine Learning, etc.). Please see <a href="https://viet-wics.github.io/">Vietnamese Women in Computer Science</a> for reference.</p>

<hr />

<p><i><strong>Computer Scientist is a men… working in a dark, cool, eccentric room</strong></i></p>

<p>Beyond gender-specific stereotypes, I’ve personally grappled with the unsettling notion that pursuing scientific research would disconnect me from a passionate, diverse community. Perhaps this stems from media representations (e.g., Sheldon Cooper in Big Bang Theory) that have perpetuated a narrow, sensationalized image of scientists as exclusively “cool” or “eccentric.”</p>

<p>During a course on Educational Psychology, I encountered a fascinating concept that articulated my unease: “ambient belonging”.</p>

<div style="background-color: #EDEDFF; padding: 10px; border-radius: 10px; width: 90%; margin: 0 auto;">
<i>Ambient belonging includes fit with the material (e.g., physical objects) and structural (e.g., layout) components of an environment along with a sense of fit with the people who are imagined to occupy that environment.</i>
</div>
<p><br />
Consider the stereotypical image of a computer scientist: often visualized as someone sequestered in a dark room, programming with intense focus. Research has demonstrated that such <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2009-22579-003">preconceived notions of ambient belonging can significantly diminish students’ interest in pursuing scientific fields!</a></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Candidly, I once subscribed to these stereotypes. However, I’ve since recognized their absurdity. The reality is far more nuanced: you can personalize your workspace however you desire, and not every programmer fits the narrow, dramatized television portrayal. My own workspace at VinAI—and those in large tech companies—are testament to this diversity. Most of the time, your working enviroments will be neutral and… even a bit “boring”! (But you and decorate in the way that you want~)
<!-- Moreover, my experiences at two major conferences, NeurIPS 2023 in AI and CVPR 2024 in Computer Vision, were particularly illuminating. The substantial female participation showcased incredible individual diversity. During poster presentations, participants demonstrated remarkable creativity, challenging every preconceived notion. --></p>

  <p>Quick summary:<br />Women can do Computer Science, and the “stereotypes” you imagine about the field are likely far from reality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fundamental truth is simple: you can be authentically yourself and still pursue scientific excellence.</p>

<!-- I’m not sure where this “stereotype” originated, but it’s probably one of the most common and earliest ones. In a study conducted by Heriot-Watt University, when students aged 13–17 were asked to draw their “image” of Computer Science, many of them portrayed scientists as boys, nerds, geeks, etc.

This cannot be true. It may be that, currently, there are fewer female scientists than male scientists, but that does not mean women cannot do science.

There are many brilliant female scientists and researchers – for example, this website, and according to statistics, up to **xx%** are women. This proves that women can complete scientific research and work in this field. And I can assure you, there are plenty of women conducting scientific research every single day.

---

Beyond the gender-specific “stereotypes,” I’ve also felt uncomfortable about the idea that if I pursued scientific research, I wouldn’t share the same interests or environment as others who are passionate about science. Maybe it’s because of shows like *The Big Bang Theory* or Google searches and media portrayal, which ingrained an image that scientists have to be “cool, eccentric,” etc.

When I attended a course on Educational Psychology, I learned that there’s actually a term for this: 

> Ambient belonging… includes fit with the material (e.g., physical objects) and structural (e.g., layout) components of an environment along with a sense of fit with the people who are imagined to occupy that environment.

For example, if you imagine yourself as a computer scientist, you might picture being in a dark room, programming intensely... Research has shown that when students are presented with [summarize study findings], ambient belonging can reduce their interest in pursuing the field.

To be honest, I used to think this stereotype was accurate, but then I realized how ridiculous it is. You can decorate your workspace however you like, and not every programmer is as “cool and eccentric” as portrayed on TV. I have a few pictures of my desk at VinAI – and from large companies...



Additionally, I was fortunate enough to attend two major conferences in AI (NeurIPS 2023) and Computer Vision (CVPR 2024), where many women participated... showcasing their individuality. For instance, when you create posters for presentations, you can fully unleash your creativity!

<h3 id="computer-science-is-reserved-for-geniuses">Computer Science is Reserved for Geniuses</h3>

<p>It might be true many people with “geniuses talent” choose to pursue science and technology or scientific research. However, in reality, there are far more “ordinary” people in Computer Science than you might think.</p>

<!-- As quoted in an article by Hanoi University of Science and Technology: "Scientific research is, in fact, just another profession." -->

<p>A study has showed that <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/eprint/bMBd4fIHwsQwz2htWC85/full">using terms like “nerdy” and such negatively impacts women’s motivation to engage in STEM</a>.

<b>What doesn't matter</b>
<br />

There's a ruinous misconception that a Ph.D. must be smart.<br />
This can't be true.<br />

A smart person would know better than to get a Ph.D.<br />

"Smart" qualities like brilliance and quick-thinking are irrelevant in Ph.D. school.

Students that have made it through so far on brilliance and quick-thinking alone wash out of Ph.D. programs with nagging predictability.

Let there be no doubt: brilliance and quick-thinking are valuable in other pursuits.

<br />
But, they are neither sufficient nor necessary in science.<br />
</b>
Certainly, being smart helps. But, it won't get the job done.
<br />
Moreover, as anyone going through Ph.D. school can tell you: people of less than first-class intelligence make it across the finish line and leave, Ph.D. in hand.
<br />
As my advisor used to tell me, "Whenever I felt depressed in grad school--when I worried I wasn't going to finish my Ph.D.--I looked at the people dumber than me finishing theirs, and I would think to myself, if that idiot can get a Ph.D., dammit, so can I."
<br />
Since becoming a professor, I finding myself repeating a corollary of this observation, but I replace "getting a Ph.D." with "obtaining grant funding."<br />

<!-- From another perspective, I used to think that doing Computer Science meant working on complicated, incomprehensible things, but I later realized there are countless topics in Computer Science you can explore. If you enjoy "complex computations," you can pursue it, like your teacher. If you prefer other topics… those are possible too. -->
<!-- Indeed, there are many aspects of Computer Science research, forming a whole spectrum for you to explore. -->

<!-- It’s true that many people with “innate talent” choose to pursue science and technology or scientific research. However, in reality, there are far more “ordinary” people in science than you might think. A study by [Starr] showed that using terms like “nerdy” and such negatively impacts women’s motivation to engage in science and technology.

As quoted in an article by Hanoi University of Science and Technology: “Scientific research is, in fact, just another profession.”

> "I'm not a Science Nerd!": STEM Stereotypes, Identity, and Motivation Among Undergraduate Women  
Stereotypes reduce women’s identification with science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM), which can decrease their motivation to enter STEM domains. Stereotypes may be gender-based (e.g., STEM is for men) or trait-based (e.g., STEM is for geniuses). ...  
The results highlight the unique contributions of different stereotypes toward women’s STEM identity and, in turn, their motivation to pursue STEM pathways. Practice implications include addressing nerd-genius stereotypes in STEM interventions and reducing classroom artifacts that might be reminiscent of these stereotypes.

This stereotype shouldn’t exist. I haven’t completed my PhD yet, so I can’t say much, but I’ll translate Professor Matt Might’s words here:  
[https://matt.might.net/articles/successful-phd-students/](https://matt.might.net/articles/successful-phd-students/)

From another perspective, I used to think that doing science meant working on complicated, incomprehensible things [insert image], but I later realized there are countless topics in Computer Science you can explore. If you enjoy “complex computations,” you can pursue it, like [your teacher]. If you prefer other topics… those are possible too.

Indeed, there are many aspects of Computer Science research, forming a whole spectrum for you to explore. -->

<hr />

<h1 id="women-studying-computer-science-are-unattractive-or-will-stay-single">Women Studying Computer Science Are “Unattractive” or Will Stay Single?</h1>

<p>I’ve heard this stereotype too often from friends and relatives. Even at Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST), there’s an infamous saying:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“HUST boys are like parrots,<br />
HUST girls are like baked cassava roots.”<br />
(In Vietnamese: “Trai Bách Khoa như chim Anh Vũ; Gái Bách Khoa như củ sắn lùi”)</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- Comparing “HUST girls” to “cassava roots” often carries more criticism than praise. It’s true that female students at HUST may focus less on grooming or lack glamorous appearances, and no “HUST girl” has ever won beauty pageants like those at Foreign Trade University or National Economics University... -->

<p>This caustic comparison reveals more than just a crude joke—it exposes a pervasive social narrative that reduces women in technical fields to being unattractive, undesirable, or socially unsuccessful. The stereotype suggests that female students who pursue science and technology somehow sacrifice their femininity or romantic prospects.</p>

<!-- In reality, this perception is not just offensive—it's fundamentally incorrect. Research has consistently shown that academic achievement and personal attractiveness are unrelated. A study by Moss-Racusin et al. (2012) demonstrated that gender stereotypes in scientific fields are deeply ingrained but ultimately baseless, with women showing equal competence and potential in STEM disciplines. -->

<p>Research supports that women often face a societal conflict between pursuing STEM and adhering to traditional gender roles. Studies suggest that romantic goals, tied to societal expectations, can discourage women from engaging in STEM. For example, research found that <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167211408436">women exposed to romantic contexts reported less positive attitudes toward STEM, while men showed no such conflict</a>.</p>

<!-- [Summarize relevant research – e.g., *Effects of Everyday Romantic Goal Pursuit on Women’s Attitudes Toward Math and Science*] -->

<!-- From my personal experience, however, studying technology does not make you less attractive. On the contrary, I feel grateful that studying STEM allowed me to meet many talented and kind male peers!   -->

<p>From my personal experience, studying technology has been anything but a social limitation. If anything, it has been incredibly empowering. The skills I’ve developed—critical thinking, problem-solving, technical expertise—have made me more confident and interesting. Contrary to the stereotype, studying STEM has allowed me to meet incredibly talented and kind peers, including amazing male colleagues who value intelligence and passion.</p>

<!-- Moreover, countless successful women in science demonstrate that professional achievement and personal fulfillment are not mutually exclusive. The narrative that women in STEM are destined to be single or unattractive is not just false—it's harmful. It discourages talented young women from pursuing their academic and professional passions, limiting their potential and perpetuating a cycle of gender bias. -->

<p>Just look around, and you’ll see that <b>scientists can love, live, and thrive just like anyone else</b>.
My journey in STEM has taught me that attractiveness is about so much more than appearance—it’s also about passion, intelligence, and the ability to do/ join impactful research!</p>

<p>To anyone who still believes that girls in STEM/ Computer Science are “unattractive” or unlikely to find love: think again!</p>

<!-- ### Reflecting on the Reasons I Kept Going

1. **Curiosity**<br>
   Curiosity has been my compass, driving me forward through uncertainty.
   - Curious to see how far a small girl can go with determination.
   - Curious about this world... Computer Science major opens up travel opportunities!
   - And, I am curious to learn what failure teaches me...

2. **Failure**<br>
   Yes, it sounds counterintuitive, but I wanted to keep going because I've failed so many times. You may not know, but I've failed countless times:

   - In college, I failed Economics Math three times and had to replace it with Japanese Language to graduate.
   - In 2020, I applied to 12 U.S. universities and was rejected by all of them.
   - In 2021, I applied to 19 U.S. universities and was accepted by only two.
   - And many more...
   Each rejection hurt, but I kept reminding myself that today's failure doesn't mean my future is doomed. Instead, I learned to see failure not as a stop sign, but as might be a redirectional guidance. Today's setback, I realized, is just a setup for tomorrow's comeback.

3. **Gratitude**  
   Words of gratitude might never end.  
   I want to keep striving because I’m grateful for what I have, for the people I’ve met and am meeting. -->

<p>I hope this article gives you a new perspective and (even better) inspires Vietnamese students who are unsure about their choice of major to confidently pick STEM, especially pursuing a graduate degree in Computer Science.</p>
